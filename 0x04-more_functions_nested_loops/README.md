# More functions, more nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING**. It aims to learn about nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-isupper.c` | Chekcs for uppercase character |
| `1-isdigit.c` | Checks for a digit (`0` through `9`) |
| `2-mul.c` | Multiplies two integers |
| `3-print_numbers.c` | Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, except `2` and `4` |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | Prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14` |
| `6-print_line.c` | Draws a straight line in the terminal |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | Draws a diagonal line in the terminal |
| `8-print_square.c` | Prints a sqaure |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | Prints Fizz-Buzz test |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | Prints a triangle |
| `100-prime_factor.c` | Finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143` |
| `101-print_number.c` | Prints an integer |
