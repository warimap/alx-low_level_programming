# Hello, World

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-preprocessor` | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file|
| `1-compiler` | Compiles a C file but does not link |
| `2-assembler` | Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file |
| `3-name` | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun` |
| `4-puts.c` | Prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"` |
| `5-printf.c` | Prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art` |
| `6-size.c` | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled |
| `100-intel` | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file |
| `101-quote.c` | Prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19` |
