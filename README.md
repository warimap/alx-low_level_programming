# Low-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **Low-level programming** and **algorithm**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[African Leadership X](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:
